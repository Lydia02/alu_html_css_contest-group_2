## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has been an invaluable journey into the world of web development, focusing on the foundational skills of HTML and CSS. Through the development of a websiteâ€”either aimed at connecting university alumni with upcoming events or facilitating mentorship connections for studentsâ€”we have embarked on a practical application of our learning. This endeavor not only tested our ability to creatively apply HTML and CSS to build functional, aesthetically pleasing websites but also our capability to think critically about user experience and responsive design.
